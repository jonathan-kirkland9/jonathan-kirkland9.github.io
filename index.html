		<p>My name is Jonathan Kirkland, and I am a senior at the University of Tennessee at Martin studying Communications/Public Relations and Theatre. I am passionate about the arts, arts advocacy,
		travel, and anything to do with the outdoors. Having experienced both, I love small town and big city life. I grew up in Martin, Tennessee, right down the road
		from UT Martin. In high school, I was invlovled in marching and concert band, theatre, Health Occupations Students of America, and multiple other leadership organizations.
		I always thought I would go off to UT Knoxville or Uniion University, and I never thought I would want to attend UT Martin. Besides, what kid wants to live at home during college? 
		I quickly realized after coming to UT Martin, nowhere else would have been right for me. I instantly found my place here and never looked back. 
		The faculty, staff, and my fellow classmates have been more than I could ever ask for. The BCM and my home church of First Baptist of Martin 
        have supported me in countless ways and have made this season of life much smoother. I have treasured my time as a student here, and I 
		cherish the friendships and connections I have made along the way. I am confident that this university has fully prepared me for any career path
	    I might choose. I have been given the opportunity to travel, hone my leadership and communication skills, complete internships, and to have hands-on 
		learning in the classroom. I am forever grateful for this school.</p>
		
		
		<p>I hope to have a career in the theatre industry one day. For longer than I can remember, I have been a Broadway fanatic. 
		The entire industry is exciting and changes by the hour. I love watching people achieve their dreams and be fantastic at what they do.
		I also love to perform, but I do not know if I want that lifestyle, or the pressure. I have 
		an interest in publicity, producing/directing, and theatre management. I would love to be able to make people's dream a reality and see them thrive in the industry. 
		I could also see myself pursuing a career in the music insustry,
		whether that be at a label or as a rep for an artist. On the flip side, I have a passion for Crisis Communications. I am a planner and 
		preparing an organizaion or a client to tackle any unknown obstacle is challenging and interesting enough for me to have a passion for it. I love the 
		human side of communications, and Crisis Communications is where a bulk of that takes place. I would love to open my own firm that specializes in
        crisis communication. My classmates and I joke around frequently about our firm "dream team."  I am aware that it would be a hard road to take, but the reward of living my dream would be worth it. 
		Whatever I do with my life, I know that my communication skills 
		will serve as a valuable asset, not only in my careers, but in who I am as a person and in my relationships.</p>
